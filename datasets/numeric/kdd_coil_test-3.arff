% 
% Data Characteristics
% 
%    This data comes from a water quality study where samples were taken
%    from sites on different European rivers of a period of approximately
%    one year. These samples were analyzed for various chemical substances
%    including: nitrogen in the form of nitrates, nitrites and ammonia,
%    phosphate, pH, oxygen, chloride. In parallel, algae samples were
%    collected to determine the algae population distributions.
% 
% Other Relevant Information
% 
%    The competition involved the prediction of algal frequency
%    distributions on the basis of the measured concentrations of the
%    chemical substances and the global information concerning the season
%    when the sample was taken, the river size and its flow velocity. The
%    competition [3]instructions contain additional information on the
%    prediction task.
% 
% Data Format
% 
%    There are a total of 340 examples each containing 17 values. The first
%    11 values of each data set are the season, the river size, the fluid
%    velocity and 8 chemical concentrations which should be relevant for
%    the algae population distribution. The last 8 values of each example
%    are the distribution of different kinds of algae. These 8 kinds are
%    only a very small part of the whole community, but for the competition
%    we limited the number to 7. The value 0.0 means that the frequency is
%    very low. The data set also contains some empty fields which are
%    labeled with the string XXXXX.
% 
%    The training data are saved in the file: analysis.data (ASCII format).

%
% 
% Third International Competition 
% 
% Protecting rivers and streams by monitoring chemical concentrations and 
% algae communities.
% 
% 
% Intelligent Techniques for Monitoring Water Quality using chemical
% indicators and algae population
% 
% Recent years have been characterised by increasing concern at the
% impact man is having on the environment.  
% The impact on the environment of toxic waste, from a wide variety
% of manufacturing processes, is well known. More recently, however,
% it has become clear that the more subtle effects of nutrient level
% and chemical balance changes arising from farming land run-off and
% sewage water treatment also have a serious, but indirect, effect on
% the states of rivers, lakes and even the sea.  In temperate climates
% across the world summers are characterized by numerous reports excessive
% summer algae growth resulting in poor water clarity, mass deaths of
% river fish from reduced oxygen levels and the closure of recreational
% water facilities on account of the toxic effects of this annual algal bloom.
% Reducing the impact of these man-made changes in river nutrient levels
% has stimulated much biological research with the aim of identifying
% the crucial chemical control variables for the biological
% processes.  
% 
% The data used in this problem comes from one such study.
% During the research study water quality samples were
% taken from sites on different European rivers of a period of
% approximately one year.  These samples were analyzed for various
% chemical substances including: nitrogen in the form of nitrates,
% nitrites and ammonia, phosphate, pH, oxygen, chloride.
% In parallel, algae samples were collected to determine the algae population
% distributions. It is well known that the dynamics of the
% algae community is determined by external chemical 
% environment with one or more factors being predominant.
% While the chemical analysis is cheap and easily 
% automated, the biological part involves microscopic examination,
% requires trained manpower and is therefore both 
% expensive and slow. 
% 
% Diatoms like Cymbella are major contributors to primary production
% throughout the world. The diatom reacts with 
% large sensitivity to even small changes in acidity . 
% 
% Over a three and half billion year history algae have evolved and
% adapted as primary plant colonizers of almost 
% every known habitant in terrestrial and aquatic environments.
% They respond very rapidly to man-made environment changes.
% 
% 
% 
% The relationship between the chemical and biological features is
% complex and can be expected to need the application of advanced
% techniques. Typical of such real-life problems, the particular
% data set for the problem contains a mixture of (fuzzy) qualiative
% variables and numerical measurement values, with much of the data
% being incomplete.
% 
% The competition task is the prediction of algal frequency distributions
% on the basis of  the measured concentrations of the chemical
% substances and the global information concerning the season when the sample
% was taken, the river size and its flow velocity. The two last variables
% are given as linguistic variables.
% 
% 340 data sets were taken and each contain 17 values. The
% first 11 values of each data set are the season, the river
% size, the fluid velocity and 8 chemical concentrations which
% should be relevant for the algae population distribution.
% The last 8 values of each data set are the distribution of
% different kinds of algae. These 8 kinds are only a very small
% part of the whole community, but for the competition we limited
% the number to 7. The value 0.0 means that the frequency is very low.
% The data set also contains some empty fields which are labeled
% with the string XXXXX.
% 
% Each participant in the competition receives 200 complete data sets
% (training data) and 140 data sets (evaluation data) containing only
% the 11 values of the river descriptions and the chemical concentrations.
% 
% This training data is to be used in obtainin
% a 'model' providing a prediction of the algal distributions associated
% with the evaluation data.
% 
%

% Objective 
% 
% The objective of the competition is to provide a prediction
% model on basis of the training data. Having obtained this
% prediction model, each participant must provide the solution
% in the form of the results of applying this model to the
% evaluation data. The results obtained in this way should
% correspond to the results of the evaluation data
% (which are known to the organizer). The criteria used to evaluate
% the results is given below.
% All 7 Algae frequency distributions must be determined.
% For this purpose any number of partial models may be developed.
% 
% _____________________________________________________________
% 
% Judgment of the results
% 
% To judge the results, the sum of squared errors will be calculated.
% The following Table describes the results of a particular participant.
